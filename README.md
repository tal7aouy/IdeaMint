# Content Idea Generator ✨

Hey there! 👋 This is a neat little tool I built to help content creators generate detailed outlines and descriptions for their content. Whether you're writing blog posts, articles, white papers, or case studies.

## What's Cool About It? 🌟

- **AI-Powered**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate smart, contextual content ideas
- **Customizable**: Set your tone, format, and target word count
- **Export Options**: Grab your content in PDF or HTML format
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes with a slick dark/light theme switch
- **Responsive**: Works great on all devices

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tal7aouy/IdeaMint.git

```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root and add your Anthropic API key:

```
